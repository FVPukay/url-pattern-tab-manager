**Overview:** URL Pattern Tab Manager groups your open tabs based on URL patterns you save.

**Data Handled**: The extension reads the URLs of your open tabs locally to decide which group a tab belongs to.

**Collection & Sharing:** Data is not collected, transmitted, or shared with any server or third party.

**Storage:** Your saved patterns are stored using Chrome Storage. If you enable Chrome Sync, your saved patterns may sync across devices where youâ€™re signed into the same Chrome profile. This process is handled entirely by Chrome; the extension developer never has access to this data.

**Security:** All processing occurs on-device.
